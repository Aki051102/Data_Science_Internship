# Task Description
This task involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to:
Clean the data by handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
1. Explore relationships between variables.
2. Identify patterns and trends in the dataset.
